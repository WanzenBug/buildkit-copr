 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 meet the following conditions:
 .
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files; and
 .
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 as modifying the License.
 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.
 .
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 Package status implements errors returned by gRPC.  These errors are
 serialized and transmitted on the wire between server and client, and allow
 for additional data to be transmitted via the Details field in the status
 proto.  gRPC service handlers should return an error created by this
 package, and gRPC clients should expect a corresponding error to be
 returned from the RPC call.
 .
 This package upholds the invariants that a non-nil error may not
 contain an OK code, and an OK code must result in a nil error.

 ## Description
 .
 The `MAINTAINER` instruction, used historically for specifying the author of
 the Dockerfile, is deprecated. To set author metadata for an image, use the
 `org.opencontainers.image.authors` [OCI label](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md#pre-defined-annotation-keys).
 .
 ## Examples
 .
 ❌ Bad: don't use the `MAINTAINER` instruction
 .
 ```dockerfile
 MAINTAINER moby@example.com
 ```
 .
 ✅ Good: specify the author using the `org.opencontainers.image.authors` label
 .
 ```dockerfile

 Package spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in
 debugging.
 .
 A quick overview of the additional features spew provides over the built-in
 printing facilities for Go data types are as follows:
 .
 * Pointers are dereferenced and followed
 * Circular data structures are detected and handled properly
 * Custom Stringer/error interfaces are optionally invoked, including
 on unexported types
 * Custom types which only implement the Stringer/error interfaces via
 a pointer receiver are optionally invoked when passing non-pointer
 variables
 * Byte arrays and slices are dumped like the hexdump -C command which
 includes offsets, byte values in hex, and ASCII output (only when using
 Dump style)
 .
 There are two different approaches spew allows for dumping Go data structures:
 .
 * Dump style which prints with newlines, customizable indentation,
 and additional debug information such as types and all pointer addresses
 used to indirect to the final value
 * A custom Formatter interface that integrates cleanly with the standard fmt
 package and replaces %v, %+v, %#v, and %#+v to provide inline printing
 similar to the default %v while providing the additional functionality
 outlined above and passing unsupported format verbs such as %x and %q
 along to fmt
 .
 Quick Start
 .
 This section demonstrates how to quickly get started with spew.  See the
 sections below for further details on formatting and configuration options.
 .
 To dump a variable with full newlines, indentation, type, and pointer
 information use Dump, Fdump, or Sdump:
 spew.Dump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
 spew.Fdump(someWriter, myVar1, myVar2, ...)

 Package baggage provides base types and functionality to store and retrieve
 baggage in Go context. This package exists because the OpenTracing bridge to
 OpenTelemetry needs to synchronize state whenever baggage for a context is
 modified and that context contains an OpenTracing span. If it were not for
 this need this package would not need to exist and the
 `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage` package would be the singular place where
 W3C baggage is handled.

 Package prometheus is the core instrumentation package. It provides metrics
 primitives to instrument code for monitoring. It also offers a registry for
 metrics. Sub-packages allow to expose the registered metrics via HTTP
 (package promhttp) or push them to a Pushgateway (package push). There is
 also a sub-package promauto, which provides metrics constructors with
 automatic registration.
 .
 All exported functions and methods are safe to be used concurrently unless
 specified otherwise.
 .
 # A Basic Example
 .
 As a starting point, a very basic usage example:
 .
 package main
 .
 import (
 "log"
 "net/http"

 Sandbox is a v2 runtime extension that allows more complex execution environments for containers.
 This adds a notion of groups of containers that share same lifecycle and/or resources.
 A few good fits for sandbox can be:
 - A "pause" container in k8s, that acts as a parent process for child containers to hold network namespace.
 - (micro)VMs that launch a VM process and executes containers inside guest OS.
 containerd in this case remains implementation agnostic and delegates sandbox handling to runtimes.

 This design derives from Dave Cheney's blog:
 http://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/05/lets-talk-about-logging
 .
 Package logr defines a general-purpose logging API and abstract interfaces
 to back that API.  Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,
 while callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.
 .
 # Usage
 .
 Logging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with
 methods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main
 methods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()
 are key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing
 "structured logging".
 .
 With Go's standard log package, we might write:
 .
 log.Printf("setting target value %s", targetValue)
 .
 With logr's structured logging, we'd write:
 .
 logger.Info("setting target", "value", targetValue)
 .
 Errors are much the same.  Instead of:
 .
 log.Printf("failed to open the pod bay door for user %s: %v", user, err)
 .
 We'd write:
 .
 logger.Error(err, "failed to open the pod bay door", "user", user)
 .
 Info() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that
 LogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional
 information (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are
 always logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error
 instance available, passing nil is valid.
 .
 # Verbosity
 .
 Often we want to log information only when the application in "verbose
 mode".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.
 The higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.
 Log-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not
 be written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same
 meaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).
 Error messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.
 .
 Where we might have written:
 .

 Package otel provides global access to the OpenTelemetry API. The subpackages of
 the otel package provide an implementation of the OpenTelemetry API.
 .
 The provided API is used to instrument code and measure data about that code's
 performance and operation. The measured data, by default, is not processed or
 transmitted anywhere. An implementation of the OpenTelemetry SDK, like the
 default SDK implementation (go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk), and associated
 exporters are used to process and transport this data.
 .
 To read the getting started guide, see https://opentelemetry.io/docs/go/getting-started/.

 Package filters defines a syntax and parser that can be used for the
 filtration of items across the containerd API. The core is built on the
 concept of protobuf field paths, with quoting.  Several operators allow the
 user to flexibly select items based on field presence, equality, inequality
 and regular expressions. Flexible adaptors support working with any type.
 .
 The syntax is fairly familiar, if you've used container ecosystem
 projects.  At the core, we base it on the concept of protobuf field
 paths, augmenting with the ability to quote portions of the field path
 to match arbitrary labels. These "selectors" come in the following
 syntax:
 .
 ```
 <fieldpath>[<operator><value>]
 ```
 .
 A basic example is as follows:
 .
 ```

 Package noop provides an implementation of the OpenTelemetry metric API that
 produces no telemetry and minimizes used computation resources.
 .
 Using this package to implement the OpenTelemetry metric API will
 effectively disable OpenTelemetry.
 .
 This implementation can be embedded in other implementations of the
 OpenTelemetry metric API. Doing so will mean the implementation defaults to
 no operation for methods it does not implement.

 Package metadata stores all labels and object specific metadata by namespace.
 This package also contains the main garbage collection logic for cleaning up
 resources consistently and atomically. Resources used by backends will be
 tracked in the metadata store to be exposed to consumers of this package.
 .
 The layout where a "/" delineates a bucket is described in the following
 section. Please try to follow this as closely as possible when adding
 functionality. We can bolster this with helpers and more structure if that
 becomes an issue.
 .
 Generically, we try to do the following:
 .
 <version>/<namespace>/<object>/<key> -> <field>
 .
 version: Currently, this is "v1". Additions can be made to v1 in a backwards
 compatible way. If the layout changes, a new version must be made, along
 with a migration.
 .
 namespace: the namespace to which this object belongs.
 .
 object: defines which object set is stored in the bucket. There are two
 special objects, "labels" and "indexes". The "labels" bucket stores the
 labels for the parent namespace. The "indexes" object is reserved for
 indexing objects, if we require in the future.
 .
 key: object-specific key identifying the storage bucket for the objects
 contents.
 .
 Below is the current database schema. This should be updated each time
 the structure is changed in addition to adding a migration and incrementing
 the database version.
 Notes:
 .
 - `╘══*...*` refers to maps with arbitrary keys
 .
 - `version` is a key to a numeric value identifying the minor revisions
 of schema version
 .
 - a namespace in a schema bucket cannot be named "version"

 Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message
 digests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is
 designed to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.
 More importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with
 hash.Hash-based digests with little effort.
 .
 Basics
 .
 The format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the
 "algorithm" and the "digest", separated by a colon:
 .
 <algorithm>:<digest>
 .
 An example of a sha256 digest representation follows:
 .
 sha256:7173b809ca12ec5dee4506cd86be934c4596dd234ee82c0662eac04a8c2c71dc
 .
 The "algorithm" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate
 the digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to "hex"
 if not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their
 digests encoded in hex strings.
 .
 In the example above, the string "sha256" is the algorithm and the hex bytes
 are the "digest".
 .
 Because the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is
 obtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the
 standard equality operator.
 .
 Verification
 .
 The main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a
 given digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash
 interface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After
 writing is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate
 whether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.
 .
 Missing Features
 .
 In addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this
 package:
 .
 1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.
 .
 2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.

 Package noop provides an implementation of the OpenTelemetry trace API that
 produces no telemetry and minimizes used computation resources.
 .
 Using this package to implement the OpenTelemetry trace API will effectively
 disable OpenTelemetry.
 .
 This implementation can be embedded in other implementations of the
 OpenTelemetry trace API. Doing so will mean the implementation defaults to
 no operation for methods it does not implement.

 This file is a simple protocol buffer encoder and decoder.
 The format is described at
 https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding
 .
 A protocol message must implement the message interface:
 decoder() []decoder
 encode(*buffer)
 .
 The decode method returns a slice indexed by field number that gives the
 function to decode that field.
 The encode method encodes its receiver into the given buffer.
 .
 The two methods are simple enough to be implemented by hand rather than
 by using a protocol compiler.
 .
 See profile.go for examples of messages implementing this interface.
 .
 There is no support for groups, message sets, or "has" bits.

 Package promhttp provides tooling around HTTP servers and clients.
 .
 First, the package allows the creation of http.Handler instances to expose
 Prometheus metrics via HTTP. promhttp.Handler acts on the
 prometheus.DefaultGatherer. With HandlerFor, you can create a handler for a
 custom registry or anything that implements the Gatherer interface. It also
 allows the creation of handlers that act differently on errors or allow to
 log errors.
 .
 Second, the package provides tooling to instrument instances of http.Handler
 via middleware. Middleware wrappers follow the naming scheme
 InstrumentHandlerX, where X describes the intended use of the middleware.
 See each function's doc comment for specific details.
 .
 Finally, the package allows for an http.RoundTripper to be instrumented via
 middleware. Middleware wrappers follow the naming scheme
 InstrumentRoundTripperX, where X describes the intended use of the
 middleware. See each function's doc comment for specific details.

 To export collected tracing data, register at least one exporter. You can use
 one of the provided exporters or write your own.
 .
 trace.RegisterExporter(exporter)
 .
 By default, traces will be sampled relatively rarely. To change the sampling
 frequency for your entire program, call ApplyConfig. Use a ProbabilitySampler
 to sample a subset of traces, or use AlwaysSample to collect a trace on every run:
 .
 trace.ApplyConfig(trace.Config{DefaultSampler: trace.AlwaysSample()})
 .
 Be careful about using trace.AlwaysSample in a production application with
 significant traffic: a new trace will be started and exported for every request.
 .
 # Adding Spans to a Trace
 .
 A trace consists of a tree of spans. In Go, the current span is carried in a
 context.Context.
 .
 It is common to want to capture all the activity of a function call in a span. For
 this to work, the function must take a context.Context as a parameter. Add these two
 lines to the top of the function:

 Package funcr implements formatting of structured log messages and
 optionally captures the call site and timestamp.
 .
 The simplest way to use it is via its implementation of a
 github.com/go-logr/logr.LogSink with output through an arbitrary
 "write" function.  See New and NewJSON for details.
 .
 # Custom LogSinks
 .
 For users who need more control, a funcr.Formatter can be embedded inside
 your own custom LogSink implementation. This is useful when the LogSink
 needs to implement additional methods, for example.
 .
 # Formatting
 .
 This will respect logr.Marshaler, fmt.Stringer, and error interfaces for
 values which are being logged.  When rendering a struct, funcr will use Go's
 standard JSON tags (all except "string").

 Package log provides types and functions related to logging, passing
 loggers through a context, and attaching context to the logger.
 .
 # Transitional types
 .
 This package contains various types that are aliases for types in [logrus].
 These aliases are intended for transitioning away from hard-coding logrus
 as logging implementation. Consumers of this package are encouraged to use
 the type-aliases from this package instead of directly using their logrus
 equivalent.
 .
 The intent is to replace these aliases with locally defined types and
 interfaces once all consumers are no longer directly importing logrus
 types.
 .
 IMPORTANT: due to the transitional purpose of this package, it is not
 guaranteed for the full logrus API to be provided in the future. As
 outlined, these aliases are provided as a step to transition away from
 a specific implementation which, as a result, exposes the full logrus API.
 While no decisions have been made on the ultimate design and interface
 provided by this package, we do not expect carrying "less common" features.

 Package metric provides an implementation of the OpenTelemetry metrics SDK.
 .
 See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/ for information
 about the concept of OpenTelemetry metrics and
 https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/components/ for more information
 about OpenTelemetry SDKs.
 .
 The entry point for the metric package is the MeterProvider. It is the
 object that all API calls use to create Meters, instruments, and ultimately
 make metric measurements. Also, it is an object that should be used to
 control the life-cycle (start, flush, and shutdown) of the SDK.
 .
 A MeterProvider needs to be configured to export the measured data, this is
 done by configuring it with a Reader implementation (using the WithReader
 MeterProviderOption). Readers take two forms: ones that push to an endpoint
 (NewPeriodicReader), and ones that an endpoint pulls from. See
 [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters] for exporters that can be used as
 or with these Readers.
 .
 Each Reader, when registered with the MeterProvider, can be augmented with a
 View. Views allow users that run OpenTelemetry instrumented code to modify
 the generated data of that instrumentation.
 .
 The data generated by a MeterProvider needs to include information about its
 origin. A MeterProvider needs to be configured with a Resource, using the
 WithResource MeterProviderOption, to include this information. This Resource
 should be used to describe the unique runtime environment instrumented code
 is being run on. That way when multiple instances of the code are collected
 at a single endpoint their origin is decipherable.
 .
 See [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric] for more information about
 the metric API.

 Package pathspec implements git compatible gitignore pattern matching.
 See the description below, if you are unfamiliar with it:
 .
 A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
 .
 A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of
 the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
 .
 An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded
 by a previous pattern will become included again. If a negated pattern matches,
 this will override lower precedence patterns sources. Put a backslash ("\") in
 front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example,
 "\!important!.txt".
 .
 If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following
 description, but it would only find a match with a directory. In other words,
 foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it, but will not match a
 regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent with the way how pathspec
 works in general in Git).
 .
 If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob pattern
 and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the
 .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a
 .gitignore file).
 .
 Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by
 .

 Package jaeger contains an OpenTelemetry tracing exporter for Jaeger.
 .
 Deprecated: This module is no longer supported.
 OpenTelemetry dropped support for Jaeger exporter in July 2023.
 Jaeger officially accepts and recommends using OTLP.
 Use [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp]
 or [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc] instead.

 Example implementation of FileSystem.
 .
 This implementation uses stargz by CRFS(https://github.com/google/crfs) as
 image format, which has following feature:
 - We can use docker registry as a backend store (means w/o additional layer
 stores).
 - The stargz-formatted image is still docker-compatible (means normal
 runtimes can still use the formatted image).
 .
 Currently, we reimplemented CRFS-like filesystem for ease of integration.
 But in the near future, we intend to integrate it with CRFS.

 Package levenshtein implements distance and similarity metrics for strings, based on the Levenshtein measure.
 .
 The Levenshtein `Distance` between two strings is the minimum total cost of edits that would convert the first string into the second. The allowed edit operations are insertions, deletions, and substitutions, all at character (one UTF-8 code point) level. Each operation has a default cost of 1, but each can be assigned its own cost equal to or greater than 0.
 .
 A `Distance` of 0 means the two strings are identical, and the higher the value the more different the strings. Since in practice we are interested in finding if the two strings are "close enough", it often does not make sense to continue the calculation once the result is mathematically guaranteed to exceed a desired threshold. Providing this value to the `Distance` function allows it to take a shortcut and return a lower bound instead of an exact cost when the threshold is exceeded.
 .
 The `Similarity` function calculates the distance, then converts it into a normalized metric within the range 0..1, with 1 meaning the strings are identical, and 0 that they have nothing in common. A minimum similarity threshold can be provided to speed up the calculation of the metric for strings that are far too dissimilar for the purpose at hand. All values under this threshold are rounded down to 0.
 .
 The `Match` function provides a similarity metric, with the same range and meaning as `Similarity`, but with a bonus for string pairs that share a common prefix and have a similarity above a "bonus threshold". It uses the same method as proposed by Winkler for the Jaro distance, and the reasoning behind it is that these string pairs are very likely spelling variations or errors, and they are more closely linked than the edit distance alone would suggest.
 .
 The underlying `Calculate` function is also exported, to allow the building of other derivative metrics, if needed.

 .
 Package metric provides the OpenTelemetry API used to measure metrics about
 source code operation.
 .
 This API is separate from its implementation so the instrumentation built from
 it is reusable. See [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric] for the official
 OpenTelemetry implementation of this API.
 .
 All measurements made with this package are made via instruments. These
 instruments are created by a [Meter] which itself is created by a
 [MeterProvider]. Applications need to accept a [MeterProvider] implementation
 as a starting point when instrumenting. This can be done directly, or by using
 the OpenTelemetry global MeterProvider via [GetMeterProvider]. Using an
 appropriately named [Meter] from the accepted [MeterProvider], instrumentation
 can then be built from the [Meter]'s instruments.
 .
 # Instruments
 .
 Each instrument is designed to make measurements of a particular type. Broadly,
 all instruments fall into two overlapping logical categories: asynchronous or
 synchronous, and int64 or float64.
 .
 All synchronous instruments ([Int64Counter], [Int64UpDownCounter],
 [Int64Histogram], [Float64Counter], [Float64UpDownCounter], and
 [Float64Histogram]) are used to measure the operation and performance of source
 code during the source code execution. These instruments only make measurements
 when the source code they instrument is run.
 .
 All asynchronous instruments ([Int64ObservableCounter],
 [Int64ObservableUpDownCounter], [Int64ObservableGauge],
 [Float64ObservableCounter], [Float64ObservableUpDownCounter], and
 [Float64ObservableGauge]) are used to measure metrics outside of the execution
 of source code. They are said to make "observations" via a callback function
 called once every measurement collection cycle.
 .
 Each instrument is also grouped by the value type it measures. Either int64 or
 float64. The value being measured will dictate which instrument in these
 categories to use.
 .
 Outside of these two broad categories, instruments are described by the
 function they are designed to serve. All Counters ([Int64Counter],
 [Float64Counter], [Int64ObservableCounter], and [Float64ObservableCounter]) are
 designed to measure values that never decrease in value, but instead only
 incrementally increase in value. UpDownCounters ([Int64UpDownCounter],
 [Float64UpDownCounter], [Int64ObservableUpDownCounter], and
 [Float64ObservableUpDownCounter]) on the other hand, are designed to measure
 values that can increase and decrease. When more information needs to be
 conveyed about all the synchronous measurements made during a collection cycle,
 a Histogram ([Int64Histogram] and [Float64Histogram]) should be used. Finally,
 when just the most recent measurement needs to be conveyed about an
 asynchronous measurement, a Gauge ([Int64ObservableGauge] and
 [Float64ObservableGauge]) should be used.
 .
 See the [OpenTelemetry documentation] for more information about instruments
 and their intended use.
 .
 # Measurements
 .
 Measurements are made by recording values and information about the values with
 an instrument. How these measurements are recorded depends on the instrument.
 .
 Measurements for synchronous instruments ([Int64Counter], [Int64UpDownCounter],
 [Int64Histogram], [Float64Counter], [Float64UpDownCounter], and
 [Float64Histogram]) are recorded using the instrument methods directly. All
 counter instruments have an Add method that is used to measure an increment
 value, and all histogram instruments have a Record method to measure a data
 point.
 .
 Asynchronous instruments ([Int64ObservableCounter],
 [Int64ObservableUpDownCounter], [Int64ObservableGauge],
 [Float64ObservableCounter], [Float64ObservableUpDownCounter], and
 [Float64ObservableGauge]) record measurements within a callback function. The
 callback is registered with the Meter which ensures the callback is called once
 per collection cycle. A callback can be registered two ways: during the
 instrument's creation using an option, or later using the RegisterCallback
 method of the [Meter] that created the instrument.
 .
 If the following criteria are met, an option ([WithInt64Callback] or
 [WithFloat64Callback]) can be used during the asynchronous instrument's
 creation to register a callback ([Int64Callback] or [Float64Callback],
 respectively):
 .
 - The measurement process is known when the instrument is created
 - Only that instrument will make a measurement within the callback
 - The callback never needs to be unregistered
 .
 If the criteria are not met, use the RegisterCallback method of the [Meter] that
 created the instrument to register a [Callback].
 .
 # API Implementations
 .
 This package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy, all of its
 interfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.
 This non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation
 author. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would
 result in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.
 .
 The API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this
 non-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for
 unimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can
 make:
 .
 - Compilation failure
 - Panic
 - Default to another implementation
 .
 All interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from
 [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded]. If an author wants the default
 behavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to
 their users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,
 they need to embed the corresponding interface from
 [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded] in their implementation. For
 example,
 .
 import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/embedded"
 .
 type MeterProvider struct {
 embedded.MeterProvider
 // ...
 }
 .
 If an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to a panic,
 they need to embed the API interface directly.
 .
 import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric"
 .
 type MeterProvider struct {
 metric.MeterProvider
 // ...
 }
 .
 This is not a recommended behavior as it could lead to publishing packages that
 contain runtime panics when users update other package that use newer versions
 of [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric].
 .
 Finally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded
 implementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,
 an author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use
 [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop]:
 .
 import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop"
 .
 type MeterProvider struct {
 noop.MeterProvider
 // ...
 }
 .
 It is strongly recommended that authors only embed
 [go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric/noop] if they choose this default behavior.
 That implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will
 fully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.

 Package sign signs small messages using public-key cryptography.
 .
 Sign uses Ed25519 to sign messages. The length of messages is not hidden.
 Messages should be small because:
 1. The whole message needs to be held in memory to be processed.
 2. Using large messages pressures implementations on small machines to process
 plaintext without verifying the signature. This is very dangerous, and this API
 discourages it, but a protocol that uses excessive message sizes might present
 some implementations with no other choice.
 3. Performance may be improved by working with messages that fit into data caches.
 Thus large amounts of data should be chunked so that each message is small.
 .
 This package is not interoperable with the current release of NaCl
 (https://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html), which does not support Ed25519 yet. However,
 it is compatible with the NaCl fork libsodium (https://www.libsodium.org), as well
 as TweetNaCl (https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/).

 .
 Package cmp determines equality of values.
 .
 This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to
 [reflect.DeepEqual] for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.
 It is intended to only be used in tests, as performance is not a goal and
 it may panic if it cannot compare the values. Its propensity towards
 panicking means that its unsuitable for production environments where a
 spurious panic may be fatal.
 .
 The primary features of cmp are:
 .
 - When the default behavior of equality does not suit the test's needs,
 custom equality functions can override the equality operation.
 For example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as
 they are within some tolerance of each other.
 .
 - Types with an Equal method (e.g., [time.Time.Equal]) may use that method
 to determine equality. This allows package authors to determine
 the equality operation for the types that they define.
 .
 - If no custom equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined,
 equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on
 both values, much like [reflect.DeepEqual]. Unlike [reflect.DeepEqual],
 unexported fields are not compared by default; they result in panics
 unless suppressed by using an [Ignore] option
 (see [github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp/cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported])
 or explicitly compared using the [Exporter] option.

 Package azcore implements an HTTP request/response middleware pipeline used by Azure SDK clients.
 .
 The middleware consists of three components.
 .
 - One or more Policy instances.
 - A Transporter instance.
 - A Pipeline instance that combines the Policy and Transporter instances.
 .
 Implementing the Policy Interface
 .
 A Policy can be implemented in two ways; as a first-class function for a stateless Policy, or as
 a method on a type for a stateful Policy.  Note that HTTP requests made via the same pipeline share
 the same Policy instances, so if a Policy mutates its state it MUST be properly synchronized to
 avoid race conditions.
 .
 A Policy's Do method is called when an HTTP request wants to be sent over the network. The Do method can
 perform any operation(s) it desires. For example, it can log the outgoing request, mutate the URL, headers,
 and/or query parameters, inject a failure, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its request
 work, it must call the Next() method on the *policy.Request instance in order to pass the request to the
 next Policy in the chain.
 .
 When an HTTP response comes back, the Policy then gets a chance to process the response/error.  The Policy instance
 can log the response, retry the operation if it failed due to a transient error or timeout, unmarshal the response
 body, etc.  Once the Policy has successfully completed its response work, it must return the *http.Response
 and error instances to its caller.
 .
 Template for implementing a stateless Policy:
 .
 type policyFunc func(*policy.Request) (*http.Response, error)
 // Do implements the Policy interface on policyFunc.
 .
 func (pf policyFunc) Do(req *policy.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
 return pf(req)
 }
 .
 func NewMyStatelessPolicy() policy.Policy {
 return policyFunc(func(req *policy.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
 // TODO: mutate/process Request here
 .
 // forward Request to next Policy & get Response/error

 This implementation is distilled from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292
 and referenced documents. It is intended for decoding P12/PFX-stored
 certificates and keys for use with the crypto/tls package.
 .
 This package is frozen. If it's missing functionality you need, consider
 an alternative like software.sslmate.com/src/go-pkcs12.

 # Binary serialization
 .
 This package contains functions to convert to and from the wire format,
 an efficient binary serialization of protocol buffers.
 .
 - [Size] reports the size of a message in the wire format.
 .
 - [Marshal] converts a message to the wire format.
 The [MarshalOptions] type provides more control over wire marshaling.
 .
 - [Unmarshal] converts a message from the wire format.
 The [UnmarshalOptions] type provides more control over wire unmarshaling.
 .
 # Basic message operations
 .
 - [Clone] makes a deep copy of a message.
 .
 - [Merge] merges the content of a message into another.
 .
 - [Equal] compares two messages. For more control over comparisons
 and detailed reporting of differences, see package
 [google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp].
 .
 - [Reset] clears the content of a message.
 .
 - [CheckInitialized] reports whether all required fields in a message are set.
 .
 # Optional scalar constructors
 .
 The API for some generated messages represents optional scalar fields
 as pointers to a value. For example, an optional string field has the
 Go type *string.
 .
 - [Bool], [Int32], [Int64], [Uint32], [Uint64], [Float32], [Float64], and [String]
 take a value and return a pointer to a new instance of it,
 to simplify construction of optional field values.
 .
 Generated enum types usually have an Enum method which performs the
 same operation.
 .
 Optional scalar fields are only supported in proto2.
 .
 # Extension accessors
 .
 - [HasExtension], [GetExtension], [SetExtension], and [ClearExtension]
 access extension field values in a protocol buffer message.
 .
 Extension fields are only supported in proto2.
 .
 # Related packages
 .
 - Package [google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson] converts messages to
 and from JSON.
 .
 - Package [google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/prototext] converts messages to
 and from the text format.
 .
 - Package [google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect] provides a
 reflection interface for protocol buffer data types.
 .
 - Package [google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp] provides features
 to compare protocol buffer messages with the [github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp]
 package.
 .
 - Package [google.golang.org/protobuf/types/dynamicpb] provides a dynamic
 message type, suitable for working with messages where the protocol buffer
 type is only known at runtime.
 .
 This module contains additional packages for more specialized use cases.
 Consult the individual package documentation for details.

 Package azblob can access an Azure Blob Storage.
 .
 The azblob package is capable of :-
 - Creating, deleting, and querying containers in an account
 - Creating, deleting, and querying blobs in a container
 - Creating Shared Access Signature for authentication
 .
 Types of Resources
 .
 The azblob package allows you to interact with three types of resources :-
 .
 * Azure storage accounts.
 * Containers within those storage accounts.
 * Blobs (block blobs/ page blobs/ append blobs) within those containers.
 .
 The Azure Blob Storage (azblob) client library for Go allows you to interact with each of these components through the use of a dedicated client object.
 To create a client object, you will need the account's blob service endpoint URL and a credential that allows you to access the account.
 .
 Types of Credentials
 .
 The clients support different forms of authentication.
 The azblob library supports any of the `azcore.TokenCredential` interfaces, authorization via a Connection String,
 or authorization with a Shared Access Signature token.
 .
 Using a Shared Key
 .
 To use an account shared key (aka account key or access key), provide the key as a string.
 This can be found in your storage account in the Azure Portal under the "Access Keys" section.
 .
 Use the key as the credential parameter to authenticate the client:

 defined by UTS (Unicode Technical Standard) #46, which defines a standard to
 deal with the transition from IDNA2003.
 .
 IDNA2008 (Internationalized Domain Names for Applications), is defined in RFC
 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893 and RFC 5894.
 UTS #46 is defined in https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46.
 See https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/idna.jsp for a visualization of the
 differences between these two standards.

 Many of the following syscalls are not available on all versions of z/OS.
 Some missing calls have legacy implementations/simulations but others
 will be missing completely. To achieve consistent failing behaviour on
 legacy systems, we first test the function pointer via a safeloading
 mechanism to see if the function exists on a given system. Then execution
 is branched to either continue the function call, or return an error.

 Package storage holds all cached token information for MSAL. This storage can be
 augmented with third-party extensions to provide persistent storage. In that case,
 reads and writes in upper packages will call Marshal() to take the entire in-memory
 representation and write it to storage and Unmarshal() to update the entire in-memory
 storage with what was in the persistent storage.  The persistent storage can only be
 accessed in this way because multiple MSAL clients written in multiple languages can
 access the same storage and must adhere to the same method that was defined
 previously.

 Package poly1305 implements Poly1305 one-time message authentication code as
 specified in https://cr.yp.to/mac/poly1305-20050329.pdf.
 .
 Poly1305 is a fast, one-time authentication function. It is infeasible for an
 attacker to generate an authenticator for a message without the key. However, a
 key must only be used for a single message. Authenticating two different
 messages with the same key allows an attacker to forge authenticators for other
 messages with the same key.
 .
 Poly1305 was originally coupled with AES in order to make Poly1305-AES. AES was
 used with a fixed key in order to generate one-time keys from an nonce.
 However, in this package AES isn't used and the one-time key is specified
 directly.

 Package diff implements an algorithm for producing edit-scripts.
 The edit-script is a sequence of operations needed to transform one list
 of symbols into another (or vice-versa). The edits allowed are insertions,
 deletions, and modifications. The summation of all edits is called the
 Levenshtein distance as this problem is well-known in computer science.
 .
 This package prioritizes performance over accuracy. That is, the run time
 is more important than obtaining a minimal Levenshtein distance.

 Package text implements the text format for protocol buffers.
 This package has no semantic understanding for protocol buffers and is only
 a parser and composer for the format.
 .
 There is no formal specification for the protobuf text format, as such the
 C++ implementation (see google::protobuf::TextFormat) is the reference
 implementation of the text format.
 .
 This package is neither a superset nor a subset of the C++ implementation.
 This implementation permits a more liberal grammar in some cases to be
 backwards compatible with the historical Go implementation.
 Future parsings unique to Go should not be added.
 Some grammars allowed by the C++ implementation are deliberately
 not implemented here because they are considered a bug by the protobuf team
 and should not be replicated.
 .
 The Go implementation should implement a sufficient amount of the C++
 grammar such that the default text serialization by C++ can be parsed by Go.
 However, just because the C++ parser accepts some input does not mean that
 the Go implementation should as well.
 .
 The text format is almost a superset of JSON except:
 - message keys are not quoted strings, but identifiers
 - the top-level value must be a message without the delimiters

 Package flock is released under the BSD 3-Clause License. See the LICENSE file
 for more details.

 While using this library, remember that the locking behaviors are not
 guaranteed to be the same on each platform. For example, some UNIX-like
 operating systems will transparently convert a shared lock to an exclusive
 lock. If you Unlock() the flock from a location where you believe that you
 have the shared lock, you may accidentally drop the exclusive lock.

 Package retryablehttp provides a familiar HTTP client interface with
 automatic retries and exponential backoff. It is a thin wrapper over the
 standard net/http client library and exposes nearly the same public API.
 This makes retryablehttp very easy to drop into existing programs.
 .
 retryablehttp performs automatic retries under certain conditions. Mainly, if
 an error is returned by the client (connection errors etc), or if a 500-range
 response is received, then a retry is invoked. Otherwise, the response is
 returned and left to the caller to interpret.
 .
 Requests which take a request body should provide a non-nil function
 parameter. The best choice is to provide either a function satisfying
 ReaderFunc which provides multiple io.Readers in an efficient manner, a
 *bytes.Buffer (the underlying raw byte slice will be used) or a raw byte
 slice. As it is a reference type, and we will wrap it as needed by readers,
 we can efficiently re-use the request body without needing to copy it. If an
 io.Reader (such as a *bytes.Reader) is provided, the full body will be read
 prior to the first request, and will be efficiently re-used for any retries.
 ReadSeeker can be used, but some users have observed occasional data races
 between the net/http library and the Seek functionality of some
 implementations of ReadSeeker, so should be avoided if possible.

 The [Files] registry contains file descriptors and provides the ability
 to iterate over the files or lookup a specific descriptor within the files.
 [Files] only contains protobuf descriptors and has no understanding of Go
 type information that may be associated with each descriptor.

 The [Types] registry contains descriptor types for which there is a known
 Go type associated with that descriptor. It provides the ability to iterate
 over the registered types or lookup a type by name.

 go:build windows
 .
 Package windows contains an interface to the low-level operating system
 primitives. OS details vary depending on the underlying system, and
 by default, godoc will display the OS-specific documentation for the current
 system. If you want godoc to display syscall documentation for another
 system, set $GOOS and $GOARCH to the desired system. For example, if
 you want to view documentation for freebsd/arm on linux/amd64, set $GOOS
 to freebsd and $GOARCH to arm.
 .
 The primary use of this package is inside other packages that provide a more
 portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".  Use
 those packages rather than this one if you can.
 .
 For details of the functions and data types in this package consult
 the manuals for the appropriate operating system.

Copyright: 2011 The Snappy-Go Authors.
License:   __UNKNOWN__
 Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style
 license that can be found in the LICENSE file.
 .
 Package snapref implements the Snappy compression format. It aims for very
 high speeds and reasonable compression.
 .
 There are actually two Snappy formats: block and stream. They are related,
 but different: trying to decompress block-compressed data as a Snappy stream
 will fail, and vice versa. The block format is the Decode and Encode
 functions and the stream format is the Reader and Writer types.
 .
 The block format, the more common case, is used when the complete size (the
 number of bytes) of the original data is known upfront, at the time
 compression starts. The stream format, also known as the framing format, is
 for when that isn't always true.
 .
 The canonical, C++ implementation is at https://github.com/google/snappy and
 it only implements the block format.

 Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
 .
 By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
 .
 (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
 have the right to submit it under the open source license
 indicated in the file; or
 .
 (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
 of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
 license and I have the right under that license to submit that
 work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
 by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
 permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
 in the file; or
 .
 (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
 are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
 personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
 maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
 this project or the open source license(s) involved.
 ```
 .
 Then you just add a line to every git commit message:
 .
 Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>
 .
 **Use your real name** (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
 .
 If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
 commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
 .
 ### Conventions
 .
 - Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch
 - Submit tests for your changes. See [run the unit- and integration-tests](#run-the-unit--and-integration-tests)
 for details.
 .
 Update the documentation when creating or modifying features. Test your
 documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness, as well as a
 clean documentation build.
 .
 Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading,
 and maintenance. Always run `gofmt -s -w file.go` on each changed file before
 committing your changes. Most editors have plug-ins that do this automatically.
 .
 Pull request descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a
 reference to all the issues that they address. Be sure that the [commit
 messages](#commit-messages) also contain the relevant information.
 .
 ### Successful Changes
 .
 Before contributing large or high impact changes, make the effort to coordinate
 with the maintainers of the project before submitting a pull request. This
 prevents you from doing extra work that may or may not be merged.
 .
 Large PRs that are just submitted without any prior communication are unlikely
 to be successful.
 .
 While pull requests are the methodology for submitting changes to code, changes
 are much more likely to be accepted if they are accompanied by additional
 engineering work. While we don't define this explicitly, most of these goals
 are accomplished through communication of the design goals and subsequent
 solutions. Often times, it helps to first state the problem before presenting
 solutions.
 .
 Typically, the best methods of accomplishing this are to submit an issue,
 stating the problem. This issue can include a problem statement and a
 checklist with requirements. If solutions are proposed, alternatives should be
 listed and eliminated. Even if the criteria for elimination of a solution is
 frivolous, say so.
 .
 Larger changes typically work best with design documents. These are focused on
 providing context to the design at the time the feature was conceived and can
 inform future documentation contributions.
 .
 ### Commit Messages
 .
 Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars)
 written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory
 text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.
 .
 Commit messages should follow best practices, including explaining the context
 of the problem and how it was solved, including in caveats or follow up changes
 required. They should tell the story of the change and provide readers
 understanding of what led to it.
 .
 If you're lost about what this even means, please see [How to Write a Git
 Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for a start.
 .
 In practice, the best approach to maintaining a nice commit message is to
 leverage a `git add -p` and `git commit --amend` to formulate a solid
 changeset. This allows one to piece together a change, as information becomes
 available.
 .
 If you squash a series of commits, don't just submit that. Re-write the commit
 message, as if the series of commits was a single stroke of brilliance.
 .
 That said, there is no requirement to have a single commit for a PR, as long as
 each commit tells the story. For example, if there is a feature that requires a
 package, it might make sense to have the package in a separate commit then have
 a subsequent commit that uses it.
 .
 Remember, you're telling part of the story with the commit message. Don't make
 your chapter weird.
 .
 ### Review
 .
 Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the
 suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Post
 a comment after pushing. New commits show up in the pull request automatically,
 but the reviewers are notified only when you comment.
 .
 Pull requests must be cleanly rebased on top of master without multiple branches
 mixed into the PR.
 .
 > **Git tip**: If your PR no longer merges cleanly, use `rebase master` in your
 > feature branch to update your pull request rather than `merge master`.
 .
 Before you make a pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work
 using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. A logical unit of work is a consistent
 set of patches that should be reviewed together: for example, upgrading the
 version of a vendored dependency and taking advantage of its now available new
 feature constitute two separate units of work. Implementing a new function and
 calling it in another file constitute a single logical unit of work. The very
 high majority of submissions should have a single commit, so if in doubt: squash
 down to one.
 .
 - After every commit, [make sure the test suite passes](#run-the-unit--and-integration-tests).
 Include documentation changes in the same pull request so that a revert would
 remove all traces of the feature or fix.
 - Include an issue reference like `closes #XXXX` or `fixes #XXXX` in the PR
 description that close an issue. Including references automatically closes
 the issue on a merge.
 - Do not add yourself to the `AUTHORS` file, as it is regenerated regularly
 from the Git history.
 - See the [Coding Style](#coding-style) for further guidelines.
 .
 ### Merge approval
 .
 Project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code review to
 indicate acceptance, or use the Github review approval feature.
 .
 ## Coding Style
 .
 Unless explicitly stated, we follow all coding guidelines from the Go
 community. While some of these standards may seem arbitrary, they somehow seem
 to result in a solid, consistent codebase.
 .
 It is possible that the code base does not currently comply with these
 guidelines. We are not looking for a massive PR that fixes this, since that
 goes against the spirit of the guidelines. All new contributions should make a
 best effort to clean up and make the code base better than they left it.
 Obviously, apply your best judgement. Remember, the goal here is to make the
 code base easier for humans to navigate and understand. Always keep that in
 mind when nudging others to comply.
 .
 The rules:
 .
 1.  All code should be formatted with `gofmt -s`.
 2.  All code should pass the default levels of
 [`golint`](https://github.com/golang/lint).
 3.  All code should follow the guidelines covered in [Effective

 Package fuse provides APIs to implement filesystems in
 userspace in terms of raw FUSE protocol.
 .
 A filesystem is implemented by implementing its server that provides a
 RawFileSystem interface. Typically the server embeds
 NewDefaultRawFileSystem() and implements only subset of filesystem methods:
 .
 type MyFS struct {
 fuse.RawFileSystem
 ...
 }
 .
 func NewMyFS() *MyFS {
 return &MyFS{
 RawFileSystem: fuse.NewDefaultRawFileSystem(),
 ...
 }
 }
 .
 // Mkdir implements "mkdir" request handler.
 //
 // For other requests - not explicitly implemented by MyFS - ENOSYS
 // will be typically returned to client.
 func (fs *MyFS) Mkdir(...) {
 ...
 }
 .
 Then the filesystem can be mounted and served to a client (typically OS
 kernel) by creating Server:

 Package json provide functions for marshalling an unmarshalling types to JSON. These functions are meant to
 be utilized inside of structs that implement json.Unmarshaler and json.Marshaler interfaces.
 This package provides the additional functionality of writing fields that are not in the struct when marshalling
 to a field called AdditionalFields if that field exists and is a map[string]interface{}.
 When marshalling, if the struct has all the same prerequisites, it will uses the keys in AdditionalFields as
 extra fields. This package uses encoding/json underneath.

 ## Reviewers
 .
 A reviewer is a core role within the project.
 They share in reviewing issues and pull requests and their LGTM counts towards the
 required LGTM count to merge a code change into the project.
 .
 Reviewers are part of the organization but do not have write access.
 Becoming a reviewer is a core aspect in the journey to becoming a maintainer.
 .
 ## Adding maintainers
 .
 Just contributing does not make you a maintainer, it is about building trust
 with the current maintainers of the project and being a person that they can
 depend on and trust to make decisions in the best interest of the project.
 .
 Periodically, the existing maintainers curate a list of contributors that have
 shown regular activity on the project over the prior months. From this list,
 maintainer candidates are selected and proposed in a pull request or a
 maintainers communication channel.
 .
 After a candidate has been announced to the maintainers, the existing
 maintainers are given five business days to discuss the candidate, raise
 objections and cast their vote. Votes may take place on the communication
 channel or via pull request comment. Candidates must be approved by at least 66%
 of the current maintainers by adding their vote on the mailing list. The
 reviewer role has the same process but only requires 33% of current maintainers.
 Only maintainers of the repository that the candidate is proposed for are
 allowed to vote.
 .
 If a candidate is approved, a maintainer will contact the candidate to invite
 the candidate to open a pull request that adds the contributor to the
 MAINTAINERS file. The voting process may take place inside a pull request if a
 maintainer has already discussed the candidacy with the candidate and a
 maintainer is willing to be a sponsor by opening the pull request. The candidate
 becomes a maintainer once the pull request is merged.
 .
 ## Stepping down policy
 .
 Life priorities, interests, and passions can change. If you're a maintainer but
 feel you must remove yourself from the list, inform other maintainers that you
 intend to step down, and if possible, help find someone to pick up your work.
 At the very least, ensure your work can be continued where you left off.
 .
 After you've informed other maintainers, create a pull request to remove
 yourself from the MAINTAINERS file.
 .
 ## Removal of inactive maintainers
 .
 Similar to the procedure for adding new maintainers, existing maintainers can
 be removed from the list if they do not show significant activity on the
 project. Periodically, the maintainers review the list of maintainers and their
 activity over the last three months.
 .
 If a maintainer has shown insufficient activity over this period, a neutral
 person will contact the maintainer to ask if they want to continue being
 a maintainer. If the maintainer decides to step down as a maintainer, they
 open a pull request to be removed from the MAINTAINERS file.
 .
 If the maintainer wants to remain a maintainer, but is unable to perform the
 required duties they can be removed with a vote of at least 66% of the current
 maintainers. In this case, maintainers should first propose the change to
 maintainers via the maintainers communication channel, then open a pull request
 for voting. The voting period is five business days. The voting pull request
 should not come as a surpise to any maintainer and any discussion related to
 performance must not be discussed on the pull request.

 Package unix contains an interface to the low-level operating system
 primitives. OS details vary depending on the underlying system, and
 by default, godoc will display OS-specific documentation for the current
 system. If you want godoc to display OS documentation for another
 system, set $GOOS and $GOARCH to the desired system. For example, if
 you want to view documentation for freebsd/arm on linux/amd64, set $GOOS
 to freebsd and $GOARCH to arm.
 .
 The primary use of this package is inside other packages that provide a more
 portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".  Use
 those packages rather than this one if you can.
 .
 For details of the functions and data types in this package consult
 the manuals for the appropriate operating system.

 Package protoreflect provides interfaces to dynamically manipulate messages.
 .
 This package includes type descriptors which describe the structure of types
 defined in proto source files and value interfaces which provide the
 ability to examine and manipulate the contents of messages.
 .
 # Protocol Buffer Descriptors
 .
 Protobuf descriptors (e.g., [EnumDescriptor] or [MessageDescriptor])
 are immutable objects that represent protobuf type information.
 They are wrappers around the messages declared in descriptor.proto.
 Protobuf descriptors alone lack any information regarding Go types.
 .
 Enums and messages generated by this module implement [Enum] and [ProtoMessage],
 where the Descriptor and ProtoReflect.Descriptor accessors respectively
 return the protobuf descriptor for the values.
 .
 The protobuf descriptor interfaces are not meant to be implemented by
 user code since they might need to be extended in the future to support
 additions to the protobuf language.
 The [google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protodesc] package converts between
 google.protobuf.DescriptorProto messages and protobuf descriptors.
 .
 # Go Type Descriptors
 .
 A type descriptor (e.g., [EnumType] or [MessageType]) is a constructor for
 a concrete Go type that represents the associated protobuf descriptor.
 There is commonly a one-to-one relationship between protobuf descriptors and
 Go type descriptors, but it can potentially be a one-to-many relationship.
 .
 Enums and messages generated by this module implement [Enum] and [ProtoMessage],
 where the Type and ProtoReflect.Type accessors respectively
 return the protobuf descriptor for the values.
 .
 The [google.golang.org/protobuf/types/dynamicpb] package can be used to
 create Go type descriptors from protobuf descriptors.
 .
 # Value Interfaces
 .
 The [Enum] and [Message] interfaces provide a reflective view over an
 enum or message instance. For enums, it provides the ability to retrieve
 the enum value number for any concrete enum type. For messages, it provides
 the ability to access or manipulate fields of the message.
 .
 To convert a [google.golang.org/protobuf/proto.Message] to a [protoreflect.Message], use the
 former's ProtoReflect method. Since the ProtoReflect method is new to the
 v2 message interface, it may not be present on older message implementations.
 The [github.com/golang/protobuf/proto.MessageReflect] function can be used
 to obtain a reflective view on older messages.
 .
 # Relationships
 .
 The following diagrams demonstrate the relationships between
 various types declared in this package.

 .
 • An [EnumType] describes a concrete Go enum type.
 It has an EnumDescriptor and can construct an Enum instance.
 .
 • An [EnumDescriptor] describes an abstract protobuf enum type.

 .
 • A [MessageType] describes a concrete Go message type.
 It has a [MessageDescriptor] and can construct a [Message] instance.
 Just as how Go's [reflect.Type] is a reflective description of a Go type,
 a [MessageType] is a reflective description of a Go type for a protobuf message.
 .
 • A [MessageDescriptor] describes an abstract protobuf message type.
 It has no understanding of Go types. In order to construct a [MessageType]
 from just a [MessageDescriptor], you can consider looking up the message type
 in the global registry using the FindMessageByName method on
 [google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoregistry.GlobalTypes]
 or constructing a dynamic [MessageType] using
 [google.golang.org/protobuf/types/dynamicpb.NewMessageType].
 .
 • A [Message] is a reflective view over a concrete message instance.
 Generated messages implement [ProtoMessage], which can convert to a [Message].
 Just as how Go's [reflect.Value] is a reflective view over a Go value,
 a [Message] is a reflective view over a concrete protobuf message instance.
 Using Go reflection as an analogy, the [ProtoMessage.ProtoReflect] method is similar to
 calling [reflect.ValueOf], and the [Message.Interface] method is similar to
 calling [reflect.Value.Interface].

 • An [ExtensionType] describes a concrete Go implementation of an extension.
 It has an [ExtensionTypeDescriptor] and can convert to/from
 an abstract [Value] and a Go value.
 .
 • An [ExtensionTypeDescriptor] is an [ExtensionDescriptor]
 which also has an [ExtensionType].
 .
 • An [ExtensionDescriptor] describes an abstract protobuf extension field and
 may not always be an [ExtensionTypeDescriptor].

 implements the Marshaler interface.
 This allows proto.Marshal to be faster by calling the generated Marshal method rather than using reflect to Marshal the struct.

 The equal plugin generates an Equal and a VerboseEqual method for each message.
 These equal methods are quite obvious.
 The only difference is that VerboseEqual returns a non nil error if it is not equal.
 This error contains more detail on exactly which part of the message was not equal to the other message.
 The idea is that this is useful for debugging.

 The onlyone plugin generates code for the onlyone extension.
 All fields must be nullable and only one of the fields may be set, like a union.
 Two methods are generated
 .
 GetValue() interface{}
 .
 and
 .
 SetValue(v interface{}) (set bool)
 .
 These provide easier interaction with a onlyone.
 .
 The onlyone extension is not called union as this causes compile errors in the C++ generated code.
 There can only be one ;)
 .
 It is enabled by the following extensions:
 .

 The gostring plugin generates a GoString method for each message.
 The GoString method is called whenever you use a fmt.Printf as such:
 .
 fmt.Printf("%#v", mymessage)
 .
 or whenever you actually call GoString()
 The output produced by the GoString method can be copied from the output into code and used to set a variable.
 It is totally valid Go Code and is populated exactly as the struct that was printed out.
 .
 It is enabled by the following extensions:

 The defaultcheck plugin is used to check whether nullable is not used incorrectly.
 For instance:
 An error is caused if a nullable field:
 - has a default value,
 - is an enum which does not start at zero,
 - is used for an extension,
 - is used for a native proto3 type,
 - is used for a repeated native type.
 .
 An error is also caused if a field with a default value is used in a message:
 - which is a face.
 - without getters.
 .
 It is enabled by the following extensions:
 .
 - nullable

 Package gogoproto provides extensions for protocol buffers to achieve:
 .
 - fast marshalling and unmarshalling.
 - peace of mind by optionally generating test and benchmark code.
 - more canonical Go structures.
 - less typing by optionally generating extra helper code.
 - goprotobuf compatibility
 .
 More Canonical Go Structures
 .
 A lot of time working with a goprotobuf struct will lead you to a place where you create another struct that is easier to work with and then have a function to copy the values between the two structs.
 You might also find that basic structs that started their life as part of an API need to be sent over the wire. With gob, you could just send it. With goprotobuf, you need to make a parallel struct.
 Gogoprotobuf tries to fix these problems with the nullable, embed, customtype and customname field extensions.
 .
 - nullable, if false, a field is generated without a pointer (see warning below).
 - embed, if true, the field is generated as an embedded field.
 - customtype, It works with the Marshal and Unmarshal methods, to allow you to have your own types in your struct, but marshal to bytes. For example, custom.Uuid or custom.Fixed128
 - customname (beta), Changes the generated fieldname. This is especially useful when generated methods conflict with fieldnames.
 - casttype (beta), Changes the generated fieldtype.  All generated code assumes that this type is castable to the protocol buffer field type.  It does not work for structs or enums.
 - castkey (beta), Changes the generated fieldtype for a map key.  All generated code assumes that this type is castable to the protocol buffer field type.  Only supported on maps.
 - castvalue (beta), Changes the generated fieldtype for a map value.  All generated code assumes that this type is castable to the protocol buffer field type.  Only supported on maps.

 The face plugin generates a function will be generated which can convert a structure which satisfies an interface (face) to the specified structure.
 This interface contains getters for each of the fields in the struct.
 The specified struct is also generated with the getters.
 This means that getters should be turned off so as not to conflict with face getters.
 This allows it to satisfy its own face.

 source: google/protobuf/struct.proto
 .
 Package structpb contains generated types for google/protobuf/struct.proto.
 .
 The messages (i.e., Value, Struct, and ListValue) defined in struct.proto are
 used to represent arbitrary JSON. The Value message represents a JSON value,
 the Struct message represents a JSON object, and the ListValue message
 represents a JSON array. See https://json.org for more information.
 .
 The Value, Struct, and ListValue types have generated MarshalJSON and
 UnmarshalJSON methods such that they serialize JSON equivalent to what the
 messages themselves represent. Use of these types with the
 "google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson" package
 ensures that they will be serialized as their JSON equivalent.
 .
 # Conversion to and from a Go interface
 .
 The standard Go "encoding/json" package has functionality to serialize
 arbitrary types to a large degree. The Value.AsInterface, Struct.AsMap, and
 ListValue.AsSlice methods can convert the protobuf message representation into
 a form represented by interface{}, map[string]interface{}, and []interface{}.
 This form can be used with other packages that operate on such data structures
 and also directly with the standard json package.
 .
 In order to convert the interface{}, map[string]interface{}, and []interface{}
 forms back as Value, Struct, and ListValue messages, use the NewStruct,
 NewList, and NewValue constructor functions.
 .
 # Example usage
 .
 Consider the following example JSON object:
 .
 {
 "firstName": "John",
 "lastName": "Smith",
 "isAlive": true,
 "age": 27,
 "address": {
 "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
 "city": "New York",
 "state": "NY",
 "postalCode": "10021-3100"
 },
 "phoneNumbers": [
 {
 "type": "home",
 "number": "212 555-1234"
 },
 {
 "type": "office",
 "number": "646 555-4567"
 }
 ],
 "children": [],
 "spouse": null
 }
 .

 Wrappers for primitive (non-message) types. These types are useful
 for embedding primitives in the `google.protobuf.Any` type and for places
 where we need to distinguish between the absence of a primitive
 typed field and its default value.
 .
 These wrappers have no meaningful use within repeated fields as they lack
 the ability to detect presence on individual elements.
 These wrappers have no meaningful use within a map or a oneof since
 individual entries of a map or fields of a oneof can already detect presence.

 Package semver implements comparison of semantic version strings.
 In this package, semantic version strings must begin with a leading "v",
 as in "v1.0.0".
 .
 The general form of a semantic version string accepted by this package is
 .
 vMAJOR[.MINOR[.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]]]
 .
 where square brackets indicate optional parts of the syntax;
 MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH are decimal integers without extra leading zeros;
 PRERELEASE and BUILD are each a series of non-empty dot-separated identifiers
 using only alphanumeric characters and hyphens; and
 all-numeric PRERELEASE identifiers must not have leading zeros.
 .
 This package follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (see semver.org)
 with two exceptions. First, it requires the "v" prefix. Second, it recognizes
 vMAJOR and vMAJOR.MINOR (with no prerelease or build suffixes)
 as shorthands for vMAJOR.0.0 and vMAJOR.MINOR.0.

 * All GitHub Pull Request reviews with a status of "Request changes" have
 been addressed. Another review by the objecting reviewer with a different
 status can be submitted to clear the original review, or the review can be
 dismissed by a [Maintainer] when the issues from the original review have
 been addressed.
 * Any comments or reviews that cannot be resolved between the PR author and
 reviewers can be submitted to the community [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s
 during the weekly SIG meeting. If consensus is reached among the
 [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s during the SIG meeting the objections to the
 PR may be dismissed or resolved or the PR closed by a [Maintainer].
 * Any substantive changes to the PR require existing Approval reviews be
 cleared unless the approver explicitly states that their approval persists
 across changes. This includes changes resulting from other feedback.
 [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s can help in clearing reviews and they should
 be consulted if there are any questions.

 * The PR branch is up to date with the base branch it is merging into.
 * To ensure this does not block the PR, it should be configured to allow
 maintainers to update it.

 * It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people
 reasonable time to review.
 * Trivial changes[^2] do not have to wait for one day and may be merged with

 ## Design Choices
 .
 As with other OpenTelemetry clients, opentelemetry-go follows the
 [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel).
 .
 It's especially valuable to read through the [library
 guidelines](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/library-guidelines).
 .
 ### Focus on Capabilities, Not Structure Compliance
 .
 OpenTelemetry is an evolving specification, one where the desires and
 use cases are clear, but the method to satisfy those uses cases are
 not.
 .
 As such, Contributions should provide functionality and behavior that
 conforms to the specification, but the interface and structure is
 flexible.
 .
 It is preferable to have contributions follow the idioms of the
 language rather than conform to specific API names or argument
 patterns in the spec.
 .
 For a deeper discussion, see
 [this](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/165).
 .
 ## Documentation
 .
 Each (non-internal, non-test) package must be documented using
 [Go Doc Comments](https://go.dev/doc/comment),
 preferably in a `doc.go` file.
 .
 Prefer using [Examples](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#hdr-Examples)
 instead of putting code snippets in Go doc comments.
 In some cases, you can even create [Testable Examples](https://go.dev/blog/examples).
 .
 You can install and run a "local Go Doc site" in the following way:
 .
 ```sh
 go install golang.org/x/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite@latest
 pkgsite
 ```
 .
 [`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/metric)
 is an example of a very well-documented package.
 .
 ## Style Guide
 .
 One of the primary goals of this project is that it is actually used by
 developers. With this goal in mind the project strives to build
 user-friendly and idiomatic Go code adhering to the Go community's best
 practices.
 .
 For a non-comprehensive but foundational overview of these best practices

 ## Background
 .
 Errors in MSAL are intended for app developers to troubleshoot and not for displaying to end-users.
 .
 ### Go error handling vs other MSAL languages
 .
 Most modern languages use exception based errors. Simply put, you "throw" an exception and it must be caught at some routine in the upper stack or it will eventually crash the program.
 .
 Go doesn't use exceptions, instead it relies on multiple return values, one of which can be the builtin error interface type. It is up to the user to decide what to do.
 .
 ### Go custom error types
 .
 Errors can be created in Go by simply using errors.New() or fmt.Errorf() to create an "error".
 .
 Custom errors can be created in multiple ways. One of the more robust ways is simply to satisfy the error interface:
 .
 ```go
 type MyCustomErr struct {
 Msg string
 }
 func (m MyCustomErr) Error() string { // This implements "error"
 return m.Msg
 }
 ```
 .
 ### MSAL Error Goals
 .
 - Provide diagnostics to the user and for tickets that can be used to track down bugs or client misconfigurations
 - Detect errors that are transitory and can be retried
 - Allow the user to identify certain errors that the program can respond to, such a informing the user for the need to do an enrollment
 .
 ## Implementing Client Side Errors
 .
 Client side errors indicate a misconfiguration or passing of bad arguments that is non-recoverable. Retrying isn't possible.
 .
 These errors can simply be standard Go errors created by errors.New() or fmt.Errorf(). If down the line we need a custom error, we can introduce it, but for now the error messages just need to be clear on what the issue was.
 .
 ## Implementing Service Side Errors
 .
 Service side errors occur when an external RPC responds either with an HTTP error code or returns a message that includes an error.
 .
 These errors can be transitory (please slow down) or permanent (HTTP 404).  To provide our diagnostic goals, we require the ability to differentiate these errors from other errors.
 .
 The current implementation includes a specialized type that captures any error from the server:
 .
 ```go
 // CallErr represents an HTTP call error. Has a Verbose() method that allows getting the
 // http.Request and Response objects. Implements error.
 type CallErr struct {
 Req  *http.Request
 Resp *http.Response
 Err  error
 }
 .
 // Errors implements error.Error().
 func (e CallErr) Error() string {
 return e.Err.Error()
 }
 .
 // Verbose prints a versbose error message with the request or response.
 func (e CallErr) Verbose() string {

       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
